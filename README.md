# Node Simulation for Model Download Deadcow.xyz

This repository contains a Python script to simulate a node that listens for notifications to download machine learning models. This setup is intended for experimental purposes, hackathons, and should not be considered production-ready.

This is NOT a final version.

A robust version is being developed and plan in parallel.
## Overview

The script uses Flask to create a simple HTTP server that acts as a node. It listens for POST requests to download models and saves them locally.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
